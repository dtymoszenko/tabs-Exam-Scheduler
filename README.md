# Exam-Scheduler

In order to avoid Google indexing my Github repository and people being able to find my repository from searching on Google, code for this project is stored on the WORK branch, please switch to work branch to see the code.

To avoid Google from indexing my repository, look at robots.txt from Github.

Rename your repo to start with tags. So for example, instead of my-repo, rename it to tags-my-repo. AND/OR
Create a new branch, but don't make that default. Then, on the default branch, delete all files. This has the side effect of a) making the default branch useless beyond hiding from crawler while remaining public, and b) forcing you to use the new branch as master. You can still rename the now-useless default branch and the de-facto new branch whatever you want.
